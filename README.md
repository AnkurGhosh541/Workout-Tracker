# Workout-Tracker

This is a python code that uses the NUTRIONIX and SHEETY API to integrate using Google Sheets to
keep track of exercises.


You have to create a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/?tgif=d) and connect it to the [Sheety]() API.
You have to create a free account at [Nutrionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/) to use their API.
